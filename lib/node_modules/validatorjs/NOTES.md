# validadtorJS

## Preparing New Releases

_NOTE: Make sure NOT to bump version as it will be handled by `np` in step 5_

1. Create local branch which contains all the code to include in new version
2. When completed, push all code to branch from step 1
3. From skaterdav85/validatorjs create PR (should be able to auto prepare)
4. When CI completes, Squash and Merge
5. Execute np, bumping to desired version (this will allow forcing a specific version)
